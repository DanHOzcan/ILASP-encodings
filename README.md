# ILASP-encodings

This is my dissertation for the Knowledge, Information and Data Science MSc at UCL. I am using the state-of-art inductive logic programming system ILASP ([ILASP website](https://www.ilasp.com/?no_animation)) to discover novel and more efficient encodings for the recently introduced domain-based argumentation frameworks (see Vassiliades et al. "Abstract argumentation frameworks with domain assignments." (2021)). I design, for each semantics, a Learning from Answer Sets (LAS) task encoding, which is be used for learning with ILASP.
